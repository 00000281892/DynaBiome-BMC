This requires extracting all p-values, applying the correction using `statsmodels.stats.multitest.multipletests`, and then updating the `ensemble_statistical_test_results` dictionary with these corrected values. Finally, I will display the updated comparison table with corrected p-values and significance flags, and save it in CSV and LaTeX formats.\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"be649f40"},"source":["import numpy as np\n","import pandas as pd\n","from statsmodels.stats.multitest import multipletests\n","\n","# --- Step 1: Extract all p-values for correction ---\n","all_p_values = []\n","p_value_keys = []\n","\n","for comparison_key, tests in ensemble_statistical_test_results.items():\n","    for test_name, p_value in tests.items():\n","        if p_value is not None and not np.isnan(p_value):\n","            all_p_values.append(p_value)\n","            p_value_keys.append((comparison_key, test_name))\n","\n","# --- Step 2: Apply Holm-Bonferroni correction ---\n","if all_p_values:\n","    corrected_p_values_tuple = multipletests(all_p_values, alpha=alpha, method='holm')\n","    corrected_p_values = corrected_p_values_tuple[1] # p-value adjusted\n","    corrected_significant = corrected_p_values_tuple[0] # reject_null\n","else:\n","    corrected_p_values = []\n","    corrected_significant = []\n","\n","# --- Step 3: Update ensemble_statistical_test_results with corrected p-values ---\n","corrected_p_value_map = {}\n","for i, (comparison_key, test_name) in enumerate(p_value_keys):\n","    corrected_p_value_map[(comparison_key, test_name)] = {\n","        'p_value_corrected': corrected_p_values[i],\n","        'significant_corrected': corrected_significant[i]\n","    }\n","\n","# Recreate the comparison data with corrected p-values\n","print(\"\\nStatistical Test Results Among Ensemble Learners (Holm-Bonferroni Corrected):\")\n","\n","ensemble_comparison_data_corrected = []\n","# Define the order of tests for consistent columns\n","test_keys_order = [\n","    'ROC AUC (T-test p)', 'ROC AUC (Wilcoxon p)', 'ROC AUC (Mann-Whitney p)',\n","    'PR AUC (T-test p)', 'PR AUC (Wilcoxon p)', 'PR AUC (Mann-Whitney p)',\n","    'F1 Score (T-test p)', 'F1 Score (Wilcoxon p)', 'F1 Score (Mann-Whitney p)',\n","    'McNemar p'\n","]\n","\n","for comparison, tests in ensemble_statistical_test_results.items():\n","    row = {'Comparison': comparison}\n","    for test_name_key in test_keys_order:\n","        # Get original p-value\n","        original_p_value = tests.get(test_name_key)\n","\n","        # Get corrected p-value and significance\n","        corrected_info = corrected_p_value_map.get((comparison, test_name_key))\n","\n","        if corrected_info:\n","            p_value_corrected = corrected_info['p_value_corrected']\n","            significant_corrected = corrected_info['significant_corrected']\n","            row[test_name_key] = f\"{p_value_corrected:.4f}\"\n","            row[f'Significant?
